What I changed (for reviewer)
-----------------------------
- Replaced default UI font with Poppins across the app using Google Fonts for consistent typography.
- Added and wired the Favorite icon on the restaurant detail page with tooltip and working add/remove behavior.
- Improved dark theme contrast for restaurant name and address/city for better readability.
- Added runtime notification permission request for Android 13+ using `permission_handler` and included a "Send Test Notification" button in Settings so reviewers can verify notifications quickly.
- Ensured Workmanager entry point is top-level and implemented background favorites sync (placeholder endpoint).
- Persisted favorites in SQLite and cached favorite IDs in SharedPreferences for fast restore.
- Ran formatter/fixes and updated unit/widget tests â€” all tests pass locally.
